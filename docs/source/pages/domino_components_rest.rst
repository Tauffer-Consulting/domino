Domino REST API
===================

The backend service is a REST API that controls a running Apache Airflow instance. It is responsible for:

- executing operations requested by the frontend service
- interacting with the Airflow instance, including triggering, creating, editing and deleting Workflows (DAGs)
- interacting with the Domino Database

The REST service is written in Python, using the FastAPI framework.
